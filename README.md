Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment

It is an Android application that contains information about the Covid19 Virus. It contains detailed information about all countries.
Daily case numbers, death numbers can be learned. I code the project in Kotlin programming language. Retrofit, Picasso technologies are used.

## Which API are you using 🤔

I'm using this API in Android Application : https://corona.lmao.ninja
This Api is perfect. Build anything from console widgets to mobile applications with our free and easy to use API.

## Architecture 🏛

**Model - View - ViewModel (MVVM)** is the industry recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application
